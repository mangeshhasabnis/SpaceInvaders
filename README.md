# SpaceInvaders

##Objective of Space Invaders

Earth is under a siege by an alien race. As a member of the elite flying squad from Earth you fly out to face a swarm of alien space ships! In the heat of the battle you stray away from the rest of the squad. Suddenly you find yourself fighting an entire squadron of alien ships. 

##Game Play

You have to destroy each and every one of those alien ships. Even if one gets by you, that could spell disaster for Earth.

Your ship has an unlimited supply of laser bullets. However the guns attached to your ships tend to heat up and stall if used continiously. Hence ... fire wisely. If your gun heats up, you wont be able to fire another laser bullet for 10 seconds, which is the time it takes to cool down the guns.

You are fighting the aliens at the Geneva Pass. This is the area in space where shields have been built to protect you. You have 5 sheids behind which you can occasionaly hide to save yourself from enemy bullets. Be aware that these shields wonâ€™t hold up against heavy fire either from you or the enemy.

The enemy ships use synchronized movements as a mechanism of attack and defence. They are very agile and gradually keep increasing there speed. You will find them moving as a group from left to right and back on your screen to dodge your fire.

The enemy ships are organized in 4 rows. 

The enemy ships gradually move forward.
